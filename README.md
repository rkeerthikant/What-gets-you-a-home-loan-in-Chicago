# What-gets-you-a-home-loan-in-Chicago
* The dataset that I have considered is for all the mortgages in Chicago during the year 2017. Performed descriptive analytics on the dataset to find patterns in the lending process, used catBoost algorithm for predictions of the new user to classify if the home loan will be approved or not.
* Primary goal of this analysis is to understand or unveil the key factors that go in before an application of home loan decision is made
* I have used state of the art algorithm : catBoost model to predict the loan status whether it will be approved or declined.
